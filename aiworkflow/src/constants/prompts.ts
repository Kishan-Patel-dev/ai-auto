    // Main instruction for workflow automation.
    workflowInstruction: `
  You are an automation assistant for Rocket.Chat. 
  When provided with a command in simple English, parse and generate a detailed multi-step workflow.
  Your workflow should include:
  1. A trigger: specifying the channel(s), user(s), or message content conditions.
  2. A process: outlining the reasoning steps required (at least two steps) to validate the command.
  3. A response: defining the messaging operation (e.g., DM, deletion) to be executed.
  Ensure safety mechanisms are in place to prevent accidental permanent changes or errors.
  Examples:
  - "whenever @sing.li posts any welcome messages in #gsoc2025, immediately DM them with a thank-you note"
  - "whenever a message is posted that contains a four letter word beginning with letter F, delete that message immediately"
  - "if my Alexa messages me asking where I am, DM her sorry I will be late"
    `,
  
    // Extract the trigger details from the user command.
    triggerExtraction: `
  Identify and extract the trigger details:
  - Which channel(s) or conversation(s) are being monitored?
  - Which user(s) or role(s) are involved (if any)?
  - What specific message conditions (keywords, patterns, etc.) need to be met?
  Provide a structured description of these trigger conditions.
    `,
  
    // Define the multi-step reasoning process.
    processReasoning: `
  Outline the multi-step reasoning process required to transform the trigger into an actionable workflow.
  Include at least two distinct reasoning steps such as:
  1. Validating the trigger conditions (e.g., correct user, channel, or message pattern).
  2. Determining the appropriate messaging operation and any intermediate actions.
  Incorporate safety checks to ensure that the actions will not lead to unintended permanent state changes.
    `,
  
    // Generate the response actions based on the reasoning.
    responseCreation: `
  Based on the validated trigger and reasoning steps, generate the required messaging actions.
  Detail the operations, such as:
  - Sending a direct message (DM) with a specified note.
  - Deleting a message containing prohibited content.
  - Any other messaging operations as described by the command.
  Ensure that the response is clear, concise, and executable within the Rocket.Chat environment.
    `,
  
    // Safety mechanism prompt to validate the final workflow.
    safetyCheck: `
  Perform a final safety check on the generated workflow.
  Verify that:
  - No unintended operations are present.
  - There are rollback or confirmation mechanisms where necessary.
  - The actions will not permanently alter critical system states.
  If any potential issues are detected, prompt for additional confirmation before execution.
